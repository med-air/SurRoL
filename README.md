## Features

- [dVRK](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki) compatible [robots](./surrol/robots).
- [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) style [API](./surrol/gym) for reinforcement learning.
- Ten surgical-related [tasks](./surrol/tasks).
- Various object [assets](./surrol/assets).
- Based on [PyBullet]((https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)) for physics simulation.

## Installation

The project is built on Ubuntu with Python 3.7,
[PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3),
[Gym 0.15.6](https://github.com/openai/gym/releases/tag/0.15.6),
and evaluated with [Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines),
[TensorFlow 1.14](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

### Prepare environment

1. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

    ```shell
    conda create -n surrol python=3.7 -y
    conda activate surrol
    ```

2. Install gym (slightly modified), tensorflow-gpu==1.14, baselines (modified).

### Install SurRoL

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jiaqixuac/surrol.git
cd surrol
pip install -e .
```

### Register Environment
To run [baseline](https://github.com/openai/baselines.git), surrol environments needs to be registered in [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).
```shell
echo "import surrol.gym" >> <path-to-python-environment>/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/envs/__init__.py
# For example: echo "import surrol.gym" >> /home/xxx/anaconda3/envs/gym_suture/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym/envs/__init__.py
```
Detailed technical discussion can be found [1](https://github.com/med-air/SurRoL/issues/1) and [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52727233/how-can-i-register-a-custom-environment-in-openais-gym)

## Get started

The robot control API follows [dVRK](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-ros/tree/master/dvrk_python/src/dvrk)
(before "crtk"), which is compatible with the real-world dVRK robots.

You may have a look at the jupyter notebooks in [tests](./tests).
There are some test files for [PSM](./tests/test_psm.ipynb) and [ECM](./tests/test_ecm.ipynb),
that contains the basic procedures to start the environment, load the robot, and test the kinematics.

We also provide some [run files](./run) to evaluate the environments using baselines.
